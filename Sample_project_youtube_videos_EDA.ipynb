    "## 1.4. Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data selection\n",
    "\n",
    "As this project is particularly focused on data science channels, I found that not many readily available datasets online are suitable for this purpose. The 2 alternative datasets I found are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [The top trending Youtube videos on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset): This dataset contains several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos for several countries. There are up to 200 trending videos per day. However, this dataset is not fit for this project because the trending videos are about a wide range of topics that are not necessarily related to data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Another dataset is obtained from this [Github repo](https://gitlab.com/thebrahminator/Youtube-View-Predictor) of Vishwanath Seshagiri, which is the metadata of 0.5M+ YouTube videos along with their channel data. There is no clear documentation on how this dataset was created, but a quick look at the datasets in the repository suggested that the data was obtained using keyword search of popular keywords such as \"football\" or \"science\". There are also some relevant keywords such as \"python\". However, I decided not to use these datasets because they don't contain data for the channels I am interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "I created my own dataset using the [Google Youtube Data API version 3.0](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3). The exact steps of data creation is presented in section *2. Data Creation* below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is a real-world dataset and suitable for the research. However, the selection of the top 10 Youtube channels to include in the research is purely based on my knowledge of the channels in data science field and might not be accurate. My definition is \"popular\" is only based on subscriber count but there are other metrics that could be taken into consideration as well (e.g. views, engagement). The top 10 also seems arbitrary given the plethora of channels on Youtube. There might be smaller channels that might also very interesting to look into, which could be the next step of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics of data source\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Youtube API's guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started), the usage of Youtube API is free of charge given that your application send requests within a quota limit. \"The YouTube Data API uses a quota to ensure that developers use the service as intended and do not create applications that unfairly reduce service quality or limit access for others. \" The default quota allocation for each application is 10,000 units per day, and you could request additional quota by completing a form to YouTube API Services if you reach the quota limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all data requested from Youtube API is public data (which everyone on the Internet can see on Youtube), there is no particular privacy issues as far as I am concerned. In addition, the data is obtained only for research purposes in this case and not for any commercial interests."
